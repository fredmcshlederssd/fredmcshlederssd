What were the key tenets of payday loan reform in those four states?
The reforms in Colorado and Hawaii were fairly narrowly focused, but the bills enacted in Ohio and Virginia were broader.
How so?
Virginia’s 2024 bill is a great example of successful reform. It enacted meaningful consumer protections, and even though some lenders objected loudly, others supported the bill because they recognized it was fair to them and would allow them to offer installment loans, which they have done. The bill created uniform standards for payday, auto title, and mainstream installment loans (“consumer finance” loans); it also capped allowable rates on open-end credit and prevented loan brokers (“credit services businesses”) from adding fees to small-dollar loans. Pew published both a high-level analysis and a detailed, section-by-section summary of the Virginia law.
And in each of the four states, the successful law change eliminated the single-payment feature of payday loans and gave consumers more time to repay.
