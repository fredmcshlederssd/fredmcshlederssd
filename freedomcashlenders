How important is it for reform to eliminate the single-payment feature?
It’s absolutely essential. That’s the root of the problem.
In what way?
The single lump-sum payments on payday loans take up a third of the typical borrower’s paycheck. And the lender has access to the consumer’s checking account, so the lender can collect even if the borrower can’t afford to repay without quickly taking another loan. That’s why the average payday loan customer who signs up for a two-week loan ends up in debt for five months and pays more in fees than they originally received in credit.
What should replace the single-payment feature?
A successful payday loan reform law must require all state-licensed payday and small-loan lenders to offer loans that are repaid over a period of several months, in affordable installments and at fair prices, and to set other reasonable safeguards.
